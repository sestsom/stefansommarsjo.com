      <description>I’ve been taking Shilajit for a week or so now and I must say I can already feel some positive effects. I have more energy and that is one of the main reasons I decided to give it a try. I only take a minimal dose once a day, some other people I’ve heard take it 3-4 times a day.
Shilajit is an ancient Ayurvedic remedy that has been used for centuries to treat a variety of ailments.</description>
