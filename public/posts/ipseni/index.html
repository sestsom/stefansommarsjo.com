  "articleBody": "From Princess Andriana to Panagia Ipseni: A Tranquil Drive May 10, 2025, we set out from the luxurious Princess Andriana Resort \u0026 Spa in Kiotari for a peaceful pilgrimage to the Holy Monastery of Panagia Ipseni, nestled in the hills near Lardos on Rhodes’ eastern coast. This serene day trip, just a short drive from our resort, offered a perfect blend of spiritual reflection, natural beauty, and Rhodian charm.\nThe drive to the Holy Monastery of Panagia Ipseni was a breeze, covering about 18 km in just 20 minutes. Starting from the Princess Andriana (as marked on your previous map near Kiotari), we headed north on the E95, passing landmarks like Paralia Glistra and Katafigio Agrias Zois. The Google Maps link (https://maps.app.goo.gl/phdAjnHKnALrZgd1A) shows the monastery’s location just west of Lardos, near the EO Rodou-Lindou road. The route took us through rolling hills and olive groves, with the Aegean shimmering to our right. Traffic was light, and the scenic drive set a peaceful tone for the day.\nThe surrounding landscape was quiet, with cypress trees and wildflowers dotting the hills, a stark contrast to Kiotari’s resort-lined coast.\nDiscovering the Holy Monastery of Panagia Ipseni The Holy Monastery of Panagia Ipseni, also known as Ipseni Monastery, felt like a hidden sanctuary. Founded in the 19th century, it’s a working nunnery dedicated to the Virgin Mary (Panagia), known for its spiritual significance and serene atmosphere. As we approached, the whitewashed walls and red-tiled roof stood out against the green and brown hills, with a small bell tower adding to its charm.\nWe were greeted by the scent of incense. The courtyard, shaded by olive trees, was adorned with potted flowers and a small fountain. Visitors are welcome, but we dressed modestly (long pants and covered shoulders) out of respect, as is customary for religious sites in Greece. A sign at the entrance asked for silence, which added to the tranquil vibe.\nInside the main chapel, the walls were covered with beautiful frescoes and icons, the most revered being the icon of Panagia Ipseni, believed to have healing powers. We lit a candle and took a moment to reflect, the flickering light casting a warm glow on the golden icons.\nOutside, we strolled the monastery grounds, which offered stunning views of the surrounding valleys and distant sea. A short path led to a garden where the nuns grow herbs and vegetables, their simple lifestyle evident in the well-tended rows. We sat on a bench, soaking in the peacefulness, birds chirping and a gentle breeze rustling the trees made it a perfect spot for quiet contemplation.\nBack to Princess Andriana: A Day of Reflection. We drove back to the Princess Andriana, the return trip just as smooth along the E95. The short distance—about 20 minutes—made this an easy morning excursion. Back at the resort, we relaxed by the pool, reflecting on our visit. The monastery’s peaceful aura and the beauty of its surroundings had left us feeling grounded, a contrast to the resort’s lively energy.\nWhy Panagia Ipseni from Princess Andriana? Our trip from Princess Andriana to the Holy Monastery of Panagia Ipseni was a soul-soothing escape. The monastery’s serene beauty, from its icon-filled chapel to its tranquil gardens, offered a moment of peace amid our Rhodian adventure. Just a short drive from Kiotari, this sacred site, paired with a taste of Lardos’ local life, gave us a deeper connection to the island’s spiritual and cultural heart. It was a day of serenity we’ll always cherish.\n",
