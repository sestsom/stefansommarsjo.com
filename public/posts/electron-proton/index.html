  "articleBody": "I’ll be honest with you, I built this desktop app for Proton Docs a while ago purely out of laziness and personal convenience. Sometimes the simplest motivations lead to the most useful projects.\nThe Problem That Wasn’t Really a Problem Like many people, I’ve been using Proton Docs for my note-taking and document editing. It’s fantastic, encrypted, private, and works great in the browser. But here’s the thing: I found myself constantly hunting through browser tabs to find my Proton Docs tab, getting distracted by other websites, and generally feeling like my note-taking workflow was… messy.\nFirst world problems? Absolutely. But that’s exactly the kind of problem that makes for a fun project.\nEnter: Proton Docs Desktop So I did what any reasonable developer would do, I spent time building a desktop wrapper for Proton Docs using Electron. The result is a simple, clean desktop app that gives me exactly what I wanted: Proton Docs in its own dedicated window.\nWhat It Does The app is beautifully simple:\nLoads Proton Docs in a dedicated desktop window. Removes duplicate UI elements that somehow appeared in Electron (more on that later). Provides basic keyboard shortcuts for refresh and quit. Stays focused - no browser distractions. Works cross-platform - Windows, macOS, and Linux. What It Doesn’t Do It doesn’t reinvent the wheel. This isn’t a new document editor or a complex application. It’s literally just a web wrapper that makes Proton Docs feel more like a native desktop app. All the heavy lifting is still done by Proton’s excellent web interface.\nThe Interesting Technical Bits The most interesting challenge was dealing with some quirky behavior where Electron was showing duplicate “New Document” buttons and extra icons that didn’t appear in the regular browser version. I spent more time debugging DOM differences between Electron and regular browsers than I care to admit.\nThe solution involved some CSS injection and JavaScript DOM manipulation to clean up the interface:\n// Hide duplicate elements that only appear in Electron this.mainWindow.webContents.on('dom-ready', () =\u003e { this.mainWindow.webContents.insertCSS(` .sidebar-header { display: none !important; } `); }); It’s a bit hacky, but it works perfectly and gives me the clean interface I wanted.\nWhy Share This? Here’s the thing, this app was built entirely for my own convenience. I needed a distraction-free way to access Proton Docs, and now I have it. Mission accomplished.\nBut then I thought: maybe other people have the same “problem” I do. Maybe someone else wants Proton Docs in a dedicated window without browser tab chaos. Maybe someone else finds this useful.\nOr maybe they don’t, and that’s totally fine too. This project scratched my itch, and if it helps someone else, that’s a bonus.\nThe Code The entire project is available on GitHub under the MIT license. It’s about 200 lines of JavaScript and took maybe 4 hours to build (including the time spent figuring out the duplicate button issue).\nIf you want to try it:\nClone the repo Run npm install Run npm start That’s it. No complex setup, no configuration needed.\nThere is also an unpackaged .exe available to just download and run: https://github.com/sestsom/proton-docs-desktop/releases\nA Note on Security Since this deals with documents and potentially sensitive information, I want to be clear: this app doesn’t change any of Proton’s security features. It’s just a wrapper around the official Proton Docs web interface. All the encryption, privacy, and security features work exactly as they do in the browser.\nThe app restricts navigation to Proton domains only and opens any external links in your default browser for security.\nThe Bottom Line This is a simple tool that solved a simple problem for me. It’s not groundbreaking, it’s not complex, and it’s not trying to be the next big thing. It’s just a weekend project that makes my daily workflow a tiny bit more convenient.\nAnd sometimes, that’s exactly what you need.\nIf you’re someone who uses Proton Docs regularly and wants it in a dedicated desktop window, feel free to check it out. If not, that’s cool too, I already got what I needed from this project.\n",
