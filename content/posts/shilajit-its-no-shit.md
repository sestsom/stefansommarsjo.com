I’ve been taking [Shilajit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilajit) for a week or so now and I must say I can already feel some positive effects. I have more energy and that is one of the main reasons I decided to give it a try. I only take a minimal dose once a day, some other people I’ve heard take it 3-4 times a day.
