It happens that I fire up FL-Studio and start abusing the keyboard.
Go, but in the Drum and Bass version is one of my favorite songs. I wanted mess around with it and see what happened.

After a few minutes in to the song I got bored, that's why it's just a couple of minutes long. Maybe I'll continue with it some day...
