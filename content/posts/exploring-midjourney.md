I must say, [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com) is amazing. Being able to just describe a scene or whatever in text and it generates an image from that input. Love it!

Some examples I throwed at it:

  {{< figure src="/img/midjourney/TrooperBeer.jpg" caption="Trooper Beer" >}}
  {{< figure src="/img/midjourney/JustSayNo.jpg" caption="Just Say No" >}}
  {{< figure src="/img/midjourney/GoldenCoon.jpg" caption="Golden Coon" >}}
