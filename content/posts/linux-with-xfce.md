XFCE desktop environment requires fewer system resources, making it ideal for running on older hardware or low-powered machines.
It runs smoothly on systems with as little as 512MB of RAM, making it an excellent option for lightweight laptops, netbooks, and desktops.

Me personally I run Kali purple with XFCE.

Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution that is specifically designed for digital forensics, penetration testing, and security auditing. It was formerly known as BackTrack and was redeveloped in 2013 as Kali Linux by Offensive Security, a security training company.

Kali comes with a wide range of pre-installed tools and software for various security testing purposes, including vulnerability scanning, password cracking, network analysis, and much more. It also supports a variety of platforms, including ARM-based systems and cloud environments. Kali is a powerful and versatile tool used by cybersecurity professionals, security researchers, and **ethical hackers** to test and improve the security of systems and networks.
