On a sunny Thursday morning, May 8, 2025, we embarked on a delightful day trip from our luxurious base at the Princess Andriana Resort & Spa in Kiotari to the charming Lindos, eager to explore its beaches and the enchanting Lindos Sea Caves. With our rental car ready, this 30-km journey along Rhodes’ eastern coast promised a perfect mix of relaxation and adventure. Here’s the story of our memorable outing, filled with sandy strolls and turquoise discoveries.

## From Princess Andriana to Lindos: A Scenic Drive

We began our day at 9:00 AM CEST, enjoying a hearty breakfast at the Princess Andriana’s buffet set us up for the exciting day. The resort, nestled in Kiotari with its modern amenities and proximity to the beach, were our cozy home base. We jumped into our rental car, a compact Opel Corsa and we hit the road for Lindos.

We headed northeast, passing landmarks like Paralia Glistra and Katafigio Agrias Zois (a wildlife refuge). The road hugged the coast, offering glimpses of the Aegean’s deep blue and passing through areas like Lardos Beach and Plakia Beach. The landscape shifted from Kiotari’s resort-lined shores to rugged hills dotted with olive groves, building up our excitement.
We arrived in Lindos by 11:00 and parked the car near Lindos Beach. Cars aren’t allowed in the village to preserve its pedestrian charm. We laced up our walking shoes and stepped into Lindos’ whitewashed wonderland.

## Exploring Lindos’ Beaches: Coastal Bliss

Our plan was to soak in Lindos’ coastal beauty, starting with its beaches. We first walked to Lindos Beach and Pallas Beach. The golden-sand beaches were lively with families and couples, its clear waters shimmering under the May sun (around 27°C, typical for this time of year). We walked along the shore, the sand warm under our feet’s, collecting small pebbles and admiring the village’s white houses climbing the hillside. Tamarisk trees offered shade, and we paused to drink some water watching people splashing in the shallows.

Walking both beaches, we felt Lindos’ effortless charm. The May weather was ideal, sunny but not scorching, with a gentle breeze.

## The Lindos Sea Caves: A Glowing Escape

By 11:30, we were ready for the highlight: the Lindos Sea Caves.

The caves were magical. The main Lindos Cave, just off the coast, opened into a cavern where sunlight streamed through ceiling cracks, casting a turquoise glow on the water. We swam inside, the water was cool and clear, spotting small fish and marvelling at stalactites above. Pirates once used these caves as hideouts, adding a thrilling layer to the experience.

For those skipping boats, a coastal path from Lindos (about 20 minutes) leads to the caves’ clifftop entrance, but swimming in requires a rocky descent.

## Back to Princess Andriana: A Day Well Spent

We drove back to the Princess Andriana by 16.00, the return trip just as smooth along the E95. Arriving back at our resort in Kiotari, after parking, we lounged by the resort’s pool, reflecting on the day. The short drive from Princess Andriana made Lindos an easy escape, and the beaches and sea caves were the perfect mix of relaxation and adventure. The caves’ glowing waters were the standout, a memory we’ll cherish.

This day trip captured Rhodes’ coastal charm, a perfect escape we’d happily repeat.
