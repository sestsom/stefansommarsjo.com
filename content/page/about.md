Hi there! My name is Stefan Sommarsjö and I’m a creator at heart. 
Whether it’s through my lens, my music, or my code, I love nothing more than bringing ideas to life.

As a photographer, I’m constantly inspired by the world around me and the stories it holds. Capturing those moments and sharing them with others brings me immense joy. From landscapes to portraits, I love experimenting with different styles and techniques to see what works best.

Music has also been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. Whether it’s tapping the table or producing beats on the computer, creating music allows me to express myself in ways words can’t. It’s a constant source of inspiration and a way for me to connect with others.

In addition to photography and music, I also have a passion for coding. I love the challenge of solving problems and the feeling of accomplishment when a project comes together. Whether I’m working on a website or an app, I enjoy the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality through code.

Overall, I’m constantly striving to learn and improve my skills.
